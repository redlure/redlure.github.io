# Installing the redlure-worker
Workers require root privileges to run. To install a worker on your system run the following commands:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/redlure/redlure-worker.git
cd redlure-worker
sudo ./install.sh
sudo pipenv run ./redlure-worker.py
```

The worker currently utlilzes Python3.8.

## Configuration
Before you boot the worker up, you'll need to add some values to `config.py` so that the worker can communicate with your console. The two you'll need to add values for are:
- `API_KEY` - set to the value generated by the redlure-console in the web interface (*Domains & Servers* page)
- `SERVER_IP` - set to the IP address or domain name where your redlure-console is hosted

The other config values are default, and may not require editing:
- `CERT_PATH` and `KEY_PATH` - can be set to custom SSL certificates. Self-signed certs will be generated on startup otherwise.
- `WORKER_PORT` - set the port the worker will use on startup
- `SERVER_PORT` - set to the port your redlure-console is listening on

## Hardware and OS
I typically deploy these on Ubuntu LTS or Debian images from Digital Ocean or Vultr. Minimum specs offered by the providers are fine in my experience. Usually this is around 1 GB Memory/1 CPU and 25 GB disk space. Never had an issue with those builds. These are dirt cheap to host, costing roughly $5 per month depending on your cloud provider.
