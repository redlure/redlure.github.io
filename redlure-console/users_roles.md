# Users & Roles
This page is only accessible to users with a role type of administrator.

# Users
Here you can add new users or delete old ones. You can perform password resets or role changes as well.

*Usernames are case sensitive.*

# Roles
Use roles to delegate access to workspaces. There are two types of roles:
1. Administrator - Full access to redlure components and features. Workspace access can be restricted, but all admin roles will be added to each subsequent workspace that is created
2. User - Cannot create/edit/delete users or roles. Can't regenerate the API key. Can still access the Domains & Servers page as well as create campaigns and components within workspaces they are assigned to.
