# Initial Installation and Setup

Recommended to install components in the following order:
1. [Install](https://docs.redlure.io/redlure-console/Installation.html) the redlure-console
2. On the same server as the console, [install](https://docs.redlure.io/redlure-client/Installation.html) the redlure-client
3. [Install](https://docs.redlure.io/redlure-worker/Installation.html) any number of redlure-workers on individual remote servers

Along with the linked instructions to install each of the individual components, I've created a [blog](https://tw1sm.github.io/2022-02-21-redlure-setup/) to help better visualize/walkthrough your initial redlure deployment.
